# Banano Work Gen (C++)

I tried to make this for Bananopie, although I cheated a lot by looking at the nano node nanolib's implementations, and of course stackoverflow.

To be fair, my C++ knowledge was roughly 0 at the start of this.

Anyways, it did not end up being much, or at all, faster than the already existing Python work generation I wrote earlier, because the Python work generation relies on Python bindings for the [blake2 C library](https://github.com/BLAKE2/BLAKE2/). The same C library this repo uses. So, the result was to be expected, from hindsight.

I know a bit of C++ now - at least how messed up it is compared to Rust - so this wasn't a total loss.
